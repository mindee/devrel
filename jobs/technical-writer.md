# Technical Writer

## About the company

Documents are relics from the past, no one should spend time dealing with it anymore. Yet, the only reliable connectors available to get data from the physical world (documents) to the digital world (software) are humans.

At Mindee, we are changing that by giving developers, businesses and end-users the ability to get instantly all the information they need within any document just from a picture of it. Our API is both easy to use so that all developers can empower their applications in minutes, and reliable in order to serve the most demanding use cases.

Our API is being used by developers everywhere to automate critical processes such as expense management, accounting, AP automation, loan application, customer onboarding, and many more.

We aim at creating a global leader in the emerging market of document understanding software.
