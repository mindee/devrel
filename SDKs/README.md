# Mindee SDKs

We have SDKs for Mindee API for
- [Python](https://github.com/mindee/mindee-api-python)
- [Node.js](https://github.com/mindee/mindee-api-nodejs)

We also have Computer Vision SDKs, but they aren't maintained by the devrel team:
- [React](https://github.com/mindee/react-mindee-js)
- [Vue.js](https://github.com/mindee/vue-mindee-js)

# Testing the SDKs

To effectively test the SDKs, we created small applications for the Mindee SDKs. Please note that those are intended to be use by Mindee employees, and are not bulletproof.

- [Python](testing/python/app.py) - not as complete yet than the Node.js one
- [Node.js](testing/node.js/app.js)

# Additional Informations

We have additional informations for the SDKs like a new version deployment process

- [Python](Python.md)
- [Node.js](Node.js.md)
