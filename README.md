# Developer Relations at Mindee

This repository serves as a second brain for the Developer Relations (devrel) team at Mindee.

We will slowly add our processes, ideas, [tasks](https://github.com/mindee/devrel/issues) and everything needed to be successful with our community. It's a work-in-progress as we are starting to define the devrel framework, and it's always evolving. By doing so, we hope it will facilitate the start of the journey for the new members of our team, make us accountable, and being transparent to our beloved community of Mindee developers. We also believe other companies could benefit from our expertise and experience of doing developer relations.

As always, we value constructive feedback. Welcome home!
