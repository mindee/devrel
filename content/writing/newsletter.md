# Newsletter
Here are some guidelines for writing the Developer Relations Newsletter. It's a work in progress.

## Subject
It is [recommended by Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/help/best-practices-for-email-subject-lines/) to use no more than 9 words and 60 characters since multiple people will read your email on a mobile device.

## Headers
Capitalize the first word except for conjunctions and try to keep the headers short.

## Body
Gmail clips emails that have a message size larger than 102KB (source: [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/help/gmail-is-clipping-my-email/)), so we need to limit the content to what is the most important. We should also adapt our content in a excerpt pointing on our [blog](https://blog.mindee.com), video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXcb0H4P81RqvvvFfWdszoA) or to our [documentation](https://developers.mindee.com/docs) for more information.

## Images
All images need to be optimize using [Shortpixel](https://shortpixel.com/online-image-compression) glossy compression level to reduce the size of the newsletter.

## Spacing
The newsletter content should be properly spaced. Add a spacer at the end of a paragraph.

## Color
Mindee has a set of defined colors that can be used in the newsletter. For example:
- RED
 
	RGB: `253 50 70`
  
	Hexa: `#FD3426`
