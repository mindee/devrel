# How to Write a Blog Article

Writing a blog post can be intimidating at first, but it's easier than you think. Let us guide you through the different steps from the idea, to the publication of your masterpiece.

## Step 1 - Identify a topic
To get started with writing on the blog post, first, you need to identify a suitable topic, the topic can be pretty general for a start and could range from general topics relating to technologies in Mindee,  Mindee specific topics, problem-solving topics etc. For example

- How to automatically add Payslips to Google Sheets using Mindee.
- How to Convert Paper Documents into Database Records (with Examples).

If you're having trouble coming up with topic ideas, a good topic brainstorming session with @fharper should help.

## Step 2 - Create the outline
Organize your content in an outline by creating a table of content and breaking your ideas into sections. Also, add a concluding paragraph at the end of your article. For example

- Introduction
- What is Mindee
- Who uses Mindee
- How can Mindee improve workflow
- Conclusion

Youâ€™ll also need a feature image: the main image which represent the topic, or in cases where it's difficult, something related to embelish the article. The image will be used on the front page, and as the hero image on your blog post. The size needs to be around 2:1 (twice larger than the height) to fit our WordPress template. You need to have the right to use the image in a commercial setup. Here's [some places](../../../resources/misc.md#pictures--images) where you can find free and commercialy usuable images.

## Step 3 - Write the Introduction
Write an intro (and make it captivating). Describe the goal of your article and how it will answer an issue that the reader may be having. This will entice the reader to keep reading by demonstrating how the content will benefit them at work and improve efficiency.

To do that, please create a Google Doc in the [blog folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1syUDM_hb-mmX39nYLopTgQlvRLYpGpRh) on Google Drive (if you don't have access, let Fred knows). You can now use Markdown to write in Google Doc by activating it once by checking the `Automatically detect Markdown` in the `Tools -> Preferences` menu on the `General` tab. Unfortunately it does not support inline code or code block, so to format your code, just format your code using the `Roboto Mono` font.

## Step 4 - Complete the Article
When writing a blog, use your outline as a guide and expand on all points as needed. Write about what you already know, and if necessary, conduct additional research to gather more information, examples, and data to back up your points. Link to some relevant sources and use high-quality screenshots. The word count of your article should be between **800- 1500+**.

We are looking forward to this and are excited to read what you write!!!

### Step 5 - Review of your Article with the Developer Relations' Team
Once ready, please notify Fred on Slack. The process will go as follow:

1. Favour will review your article as soon as possible, making suggestions and adding comments if needed.
2. Once it's done, she will notify you and you will need to review her suggestions (accept or refuse text changes) and comments. This back and forth between you and Favour will go as long as all suggestions and comments are resolved.
3. Once it's done, notify Fred once again. He will also review your article by leaving other suggestions and comments.
4. Once it's done, he will notify you and you will need to review your article like you did with Favour.
5. Once it's done, your article is ready to be published.

If you have any questions, or need help, feel free to add a comment in the document or contact us directly on Slack.

## Step 6 - Publication

Once the review process is complete, your article is ready to be published. Keep in mind that it does not mean it will be done right away. We are trying to schedule publications in a regular schedule and not overwhelme our community with too many publications in the same week. At that stage, Favour will convert your article from Google Docs to our WordPress blog. She will ensure that everything is ready for us to publish when the time will be.

The day of the publication, we will share your content on multiples places:

- On our internal Slack, in the #shakespeare channel;
- In our [community Slack](https://slack.mindee.com), in the #general channel;
- On our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/mindeeAPI);
- On our [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mindee/);
- And on other specific communities or sites depending on the topic.
