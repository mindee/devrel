# How to start writing blog post

## Identify a topic
To get started with writing on the blog post, first, you need to identify a suitable topic, the topic can be pretty general for a start and could range from general topics relating to technologies in Mindee,  Mindee specific topics, problem-solving topics etc.  For example
- How to automatically add Payslips to Google Sheets using Mindee.
- How to Convert Paper Documents into Database Records (with Examples).

If you're having trouble coming up with topic ideas, a good topic brainstorming session with @fharper should help.

## Introduction
Write an intro (and make it captivating). Describe the goal of your article and how it will answer an issue that the reader may be having. This will entice the reader to keep reading by demonstrating how the content will benefit them at work and improve efficiency.

## Organization
Organize your content in an outline by creating a table of content and breaking your ideas into sections. Also, add a concluding paragraph at the end of your article. For example
- Introduction
- What is Mindee
- Who uses Mindee
- How can Mindee improve workflow
- Conclusion

## Write your blog post
When writing a blog, use your outline as a guide and expand on all points as needed. Write about what you already know, and if necessary, conduct additional research to gather more information, examples, and data to back up your points. Link to some relevant sources and use high-quality screenshots. The word count of your article should be between **800- 1500+**

We are looking forward to this and are excited to read what you write!!!

### Writing tool

Please write your blog post using Google Docs in this [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1syUDM_hb-mmX39nYLopTgQlvRLYpGpRh). Using Google Docs is not a perfect solution, but itâ€™s the easiest tool for @fharper to add comments, and for @fakela to proofread. For code\* snippets or inline code, simply change the font for **Roboto Mono**.

\* *I tried Google Docs add-ons and it's not worth it, especially cause we'll publish the article with WordPress.*

## Code

When displaying code examples, if you don't show the full code or the full output, add ellipses accordingly
