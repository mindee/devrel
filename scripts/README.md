# Scripts

Here a list of scripts we are using to make our life easier.

*Please note that those scripts aren't bulletproof nor do they have the best code we could have done: they were created quickly (we plan to make them better at some pointâ€”meaning probably never), so you are using them at your own risk*

## [create-all-doc-issues.sh](create-all-doc-issues.sh)
Create an issue for all documentation pages. Not useful anymore, but worth keeping for the code example we may need in the future.

## [deleteSendGridBounce.sh](deleteSendGridBounce.sh)
Delete the boucing emails from our Newsletter contact list on SendGrid

## [github-stars](github-stars.sh)
Get the latest number of stars on our public repositories.
