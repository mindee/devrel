# Technical Writer Onboarding

> Note that this plan is not final, we will review it together on your first day

As the first Technical Writer at Mindee, you own everything text-based in Developer Relations. It means that you are the last line of validation for text published on our blog, newsletter, documentation and this repository.

You will also be responsible for writing new documentation or update the content when we release new features. You will own the newsletter from now on, which means creating the content and working closely with other parts of the business to make sure it is a success. Lastly, you will write blog articles and technical tutorials on your own.

There is a lot to do, but let's start with a 30-60-90 days plan.

## First 30 days—Learning
The first month is all about getting to know your colleagues, our product and the tools we use. Everything is explained in the onboarding process that all employees had to go through.

In addition, you will start to slowly work on some urgent or quick projects:

- [Updating the documentation for the new Models page](https://github.com/mindee/devrel/issues/104)
- [Writing the November newsletter](https://github.com/mindee/devrel/issues/110)
- [Adding the text field handwritten feature information in the documentation](https://github.com/mindee/devrel/issues/34)

## 60 days—Contributing

Now that you are more familiar with Mindee, your coworkers and have a pretty good idea of the scope of your role, it's time to contribute more. In the beginning, it will mostly be about reviewing what was done before you joined:

- [Reviewing the whole documentation](https://github.com/mindee/devrel/issues/9)
- [Reviewing React SDK documentation](https://github.com/mindee/devrel/issues/24)
- [Reviewing DocTR documentation](https://github.com/mindee/devrel/issues/26)
- [Adding an F.A.Q. section to the documentation](https://github.com/mindee/devrel/issues/90)
- [Creating the missing documentation for off-the-shelf APIs](https://github.com/mindee/devrel/issues/100)

Once it's done, you'll be able to start creating your own content! It will also be the time to discuss together about your goals for next quarters, in addition to defining a career path with you.

## 90 days—Leading

At that point, you should not drink from the fire hose anymore. We still start to work on ownership of different aspects related to your role. It is also the moment when we will establish some processes on how things are done at Mindee when it comes to text-based mediums:

- [Defining the newsletter format, tone and process](https://github.com/mindee/devrel/issues/52)
- [Defining the blog tone and voice](https://github.com/mindee/devrel/issues/111)
- [Defining the technical writer text review requests process](https://github.com/mindee/devrel/issues/112)
- [Evaluating the documentation platform](https://github.com/mindee/devrel/issues/43)

And anything else we will have discussed during your first two months.

Looking forward to seeing all the great things you will achieve!
