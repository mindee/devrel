# Ownership

Here is an exhaustive list of activities and media owned by the developer relations team. The goal is to be as clear as possible on what goes under the devrel umbrella.

Owning one aspect of the business doesn't mean that only our team has to participate: mostly everything is a company effort when it comes to developer relations. With that said, we are always welcoming constructive feedback about everything we do.

## Blog

We own [Mindee's blog](https://mindee.com/blog), which means we are responsible for the quality of the published content, in addition to:

- Writing blog posts about our product, our open source libraries or anything else that is valuable for developers;
- Managing external writers, whether volunteers or paid freelancers;
- Managing Mindee employees’ publications.

## dev.to

We own [Mindee's dev.to profile](https://dev.to/mindee), which means cross-posting developer-centric content to their platform while also creating original material.

## Developer Program

Mindee does not have any developer program (i.e., Microsoft MVP, Google Experts) at the moment, but it's in the roadmap. We will be responsible for every part of the program.

## Documentation

We own the [Mindee's developers documentation](https://developers.mindee.com/docs) and we are responsible for writing its content, in addition to:

- Mentoring and helping the product team when they write documentation;
- Helping external technical writers, whether volunteers or paid freelancers.

## Hackathons

We are responsible for running hackathons which include representing Mindee at them, running contests when desirable and mentoring participants.

## LinkedIn

We are managing the [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mindee/), which means creating regular engaging content and replying to people. We welcome relevant status suggestions from anyone at Mindee or within our community.

## Livestreams

We are responsible for any eventual Mindee Twitch channel or participation to any other developer or company livestream. We are, as always, happy to mentor or coach any other technical Mindee’s employees who are invited as a guess in someone's livestream.

## Meetups

We are responsible for creating, managing and organizing any Mindee or technology-specific developer meetups. None has been created so far, but there is a near future where it may become a reality.

## Newsletter

We are responsible for the Mindee newsletter sent once a month. We curate the topics with the help of Mindee employees and members of our community to ensure a high level of quality and interesting content for our developers.

## Podcasts

Since Mindee does not have any audio podcasts at the moment, we are responsible for participating in external podcasts around technology or targeted at a technical audience. We will gladly mentor any Mindee's employees who are invited to one.

## Public Speaking

We are the first one on the line when it comes to speaking at developers' events like conferences or meetups. It includes the creation of our materials (slides and code demos).

To be able to maximize our visibility, we are more than happy to closely mentor any Mindee employees or anyone from our community when it comes to public speaking. The type of mentorship will depend on the level of help needed: it goes from hands-on help at all stages of creating a talk (brainstorming ideas, choosing the topic, creating the abstract, defining the outline, creating the slides, self-promotions and practicing) to giving feedback only once everything is ready.

## SDKs

Starting from now, the devrel team owns all the Mindee SDKs, which include the [JavaScript](https://github.com/mindee/mindee-js), [Node.js](https://github.com/mindee/mindee-api-nodejs), [React](https://github.com/mindee/react-mindee-js) and [Python](https://github.com/mindee/mindee-api-python) ones. In a near future, we will add programming languages or frameworks to the list of SDKs.

## Slack Community

We own [Mindee's Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/mindee-community/shared_invite/zt-uzgmljfl-MotFVfH~IdEZxjp~0zldww) which means we are responsible for providing a healthy and welcoming  environment for our community. We are also responsible for creating interesting content to grow the positive and helpful interactions with our members.

## Spokesperson for technology media

We are representing Mindee in the technology-focused media as spokespersons, whether they are traditional (television, radio, paper news...) or more web focused.

## Technical Support

We are responsible for offering technical support on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mindeeAPI), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mindee/) and our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/mindee-community/shared_invite/zt-uzgmljfl-MotFVfH~IdEZxjp~0zldww).

## Tutorials

We are responsible for technical tutorials about our platform whether text-based or in the form of videos.

## Twitter

We own [Mindee's Twitter account](https://twitter.com/mindeeAPI), which means creating regular engaging content and replying to people in public or in private.

We welcome relevant tweet suggestions from anyone at Mindee or within our community. The Twitter content can be a repetition of the LinkedIn content almost one to one, but some Twitter content won't be repeated on LinkedIn based on the more business and serious nature of the medium.

## Vidcasts

Since Mindee does not have any video podcasts (aka vidcasts) at the moment, we are responsible for participating in external vidcasts around technology or targeted at a technical audience. We will gladly mentor any Mindee’s employees who are invited to one.

## Webinars

We are responsible for any technical webinars done under the Mindee brand.

## YouTube

We own [Mindee's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXcb0H4P81RqvvvFfWdszoA), which means we are responsible for creating interesting and engaging video content to publish on ours . We are also ensuring that videos, technical or not, created by other parts of the business have the level of quality that defines our channel and ensure that it will resonate with our community.
