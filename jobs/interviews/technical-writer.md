# Technical Writer Default Interview Questions

- Who are you?
- Can you tell me what is Mindee and why should I use it?
- Job
    - How do you feel with the opportunity to write documentation (user & API), write blog article, edit other's writing? Probably lot more articles than documentation.
    - How do you feel about being the main resource anything text-based at some point? You'll be alone for now, but there is an opportunity to lead if you prove yourself.
    - Nothing is set in stone. No voice & tone document. No detailed process. We are a startup.
    - What I'm looking for is someone eager to learn, who have a high attention to details (links in your resume, some links or spaces/break lines missing in your articles...), and can be somewhat autonomous.
- What is your process to write about a technology you don't know yet?
- How do you come up with the topics yourwant to write about on your blog?
- Did you read our documentation? What would you improve?
- If there's a new feature coming out soon that you don't have time to finish documenting, is it better to publish no docs or partial docs? Why?
- Imagine that, by some miracle, there's nothing in the queue. No releases, no projects. What do you do?
- What do you imagine your ideal team being?
