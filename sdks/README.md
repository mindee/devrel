# Mindee SDKs

We have SDKs for Mindee API for
- [Python](https://github.com/mindee/mindee-api-python)
- [Node.js](https://github.com/mindee/mindee-api-nodejs)

We also have Computer Vision SDKs, but they aren't maintained by the devrel team:
- [React](https://github.com/mindee/react-mindee-js)
- [Vue.js](https://github.com/mindee/vue-mindee-js)

# Testing the SDKs

To effectively test the SDKs, we created small applications for the Mindee SDKs. Please note that these are intended to be use by Mindee employees, and are not bulletproof.

- Python: use the `mindee-cli.sh` file in the Python SDK [repository](https://github.com/mindee/mindee-api-python/)
- [Node.js](testing/node.js/app.js)

# Additional Informations

We have additional information for the SDKs like a new version deployment process

- [Python](Python.md)
- [Node.js](Node.js.md)
