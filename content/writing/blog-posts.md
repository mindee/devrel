1. **Identify a topic**: To get started with writing on the blog post, first, you need to identify a suitable topic, the topic can be pretty general for a start and could range from general topics relating to technologies in Mindee,  Mindee specific topics, problem-solving topics etc.  For example,

     * How to automatically add Payslips to Google Sheets using Mindee.

     * How to Convert Paper Documents into Database Records (with Examples).
 
If you're having trouble coming up with topic ideas, a good topic brainstorming session with **Fred** should help.

2. **Introduction**: Write an intro (and make it captivating). Describe the goal of your article and how it will answer an issue that the reader may be having. This will entice the reader to keep reading by demonstrating how the content will benefit them at work and improve efficiency.
3. **Organization**: Organize your content in an outline by creating a table of content and breaking your ideas into sections. Also, add a concluding paragraph at the end of your article. For example
    * Introduction
    * What is Mindee
    * Who uses Mindee
    * How can Mindee improve workflow
    * Conclusion

4. **Write your blog post**: When writing a blog, use your outline as a guide and expand on all points as needed. Write about what you already know, and if necessary, conduct additional research to gather more information, examples, and data to back up your points. Link to some relevant sources and use high-quality screenshots. The word count of your article should be between **800- 1500+**
