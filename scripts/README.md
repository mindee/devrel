# Scripts

Here a list of scripts we are using to make our life easier.

*Please note that those scripts aren't bulletproof nor do they have the best code we could have done: they were created quickly (we plan to make them better at some pointâ€”meaning probably never), so you are using them at your own risk*

## [addBlankPages.sh](addBlankPages.sh)
Add 10 blank pages to all PDF in the specific folder

## [create-all-doc-issues.sh](create-all-doc-issues.sh)
Create an issue for all documentation pages. Not useful anymore, but worth keeping for the code example we may need in the future.

## [deleteBadPDF.sh](deleteBadPDF.sh)
Delete PDFs with wrong MIME type in the specified folder.

## [deleteSendGridBounce.sh](deleteSendGridBounce.sh)
Delete the boucing emails from our Newsletter contact list on SendGrid.

## [detectProtectedPDF.sh](detectProtectedPDF.sh)
Detect password protected PDFs from the desired folder.
