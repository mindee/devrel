# Documentation

## Markdown Code Block Syntax Highlight
Since are using README.io for now, we can only use the [languages supported by them](https://rdmd.readme.io/docs/code-blocks#language-support).

## Template for integration documentation

Below is a guide for creating an integration documentation

- Introduction to the integration
- Benefits (why do users need to use the integration) Optionally, this can be merged with the introduction if its not long
- Prerequisite(if any)
- How to install/Create account (Getting Started)
- Code demo (or how to use if no or low code)(add screenshots where needed)
- Troubleshoot/ Error management(if any)
- Resources/References
