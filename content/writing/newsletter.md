# Newsletter
Here are some guidelines for writing the [Developer Relations Newsletter](../newsletter/README.md), but first be sure to read and respect our [Markdown guideline](markdown.md) when writing the newsletter.

## Timeline
- **First week**: content propositions
- **Second week**: write blog post (if needed)
- **Third week**: draft the newsletter and send test
- **Fourth week**: send the newsletter


## Subject
It is [recommended by Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/help/best-practices-for-email-subject-lines/) to use no more than 9 words and 60 characters since multiple people will read your email on a mobile device.

## Headers
Capitalize the first word except for conjunctions and try to keep the headers short.

## Body
Gmail clips emails that have a message size larger than 102KB (source: [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/help/gmail-is-clipping-my-email/)), so we need to limit the content to what is the most important. We should also adapt our content in a excerpt pointing on our [blog](https://blog.mindee.com), video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXcb0H4P81RqvvvFfWdszoA) or to our [documentation](https://developers.mindee.com/docs) for more information.
Here is a guided format for the newsletter content
- Subject heading
- Introduction
- Highlight information(if any)
- Product updates(arranged based on products)
- Other fun stuff(if any)
- Videos/Presentations(if any)
- Latest Mindee articles
- Article in developers world

## Spacing
The newsletter content should be properly spaced. Add a spacer at the end of a paragraph.

## Color
Mindee has a set of defined colors that can be used in the newsletter.  The "read more" links and every other links or highlight should be red. Below is the color code:
- RED
 
	RGB: `253 50 70`
  
	Hexa: `#FD3426`

A complete list of the colors can be found here: [Mindee Colors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Myb2dETLb4QcsVZU7hlKi4ZwSFNuKLN8nexG7Qs__Go/)

## Buttons
Buttons may be included in the newsletter, however it should be limited to the main CTA. When using button you need to adhere to the standard button design, which has a border radius of `4px` and the color `#FD3426`.

## Newsletter Contact List
The newsletter should be sent to the `[devrel] Newsletter` contact list only.
