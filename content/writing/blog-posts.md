# How to start writing blog post

## Identify a topic
To get started with writing on the blog post, first, you need to identify a suitable topic, the topic can be pretty general for a start and could range from general topics relating to technologies in Mindee,  Mindee specific topics, problem-solving topics etc.  For example

- How to automatically add Payslips to Google Sheets using Mindee.
- How to Convert Paper Documents into Database Records (with Examples).

If you're having trouble coming up with topic ideas, a good topic brainstorming session with @fharper should help.

## Introduction
Write an intro (and make it captivating). Describe the goal of your article and how it will answer an issue that the reader may be having. This will entice the reader to keep reading by demonstrating how the content will benefit them at work and improve efficiency.

## Organization
Organize your content in an outline by creating a table of content and breaking your ideas into sections. Also, add a concluding paragraph at the end of your article. For example

- Introduction
- What is Mindee
- Who uses Mindee
- How can Mindee improve workflow
- Conclusion

## Write your blog post
When writing a blog, use your outline as a guide and expand on all points as needed. Write about what you already know, and if necessary, conduct additional research to gather more information, examples, and data to back up your points. Link to some relevant sources and use high-quality screenshots. The word count of your article should be between **800- 1500+**. Be sure to read and respect our [Markdown guideline](markdown.md).

We are looking forward to this and are excited to read what you write!!!

### Images
Youâ€™ll need a feature image: the image will be used on the front page, and as the hero image on your blog post. The size needs to be around 2:1 (twice larger than the height) to fit our WordPress template.

### Writing tool
Please write your blog post using [Markdown](markdown.md) as a PR in this [repo](https://github.com/mindee/content). This makes the content clearer (especially with code), easier to track changes and move to WordPress.

## Review Process
Once ready, please add [@fharper](https://github.com/fharper) and [@fakela](https://github.com/fakela) as reviewers for your PR.

If you have any questions, or need help, feel free to create a PR as a draft, and add questions or comments in the PR discussion while tagging the relevant person. Another solution is to add comments in your markdown file at the relevant places. Use the following format

```markdown
[REVIEW QUESTION]: <> (Maybe this introduction is too long?)
[HELP WANTED]: <> (How could we make it shorter without losing in understanding?)
```

_Even if not in the [Markdown standard](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), most interpreters, including GitHub, understand comments in the form of `[TEXT_HERE]: <> (AND_OR_TEXT_HERE)`._
